## DigitalOcean GenAI Integration 🤖

The application uses DigitalOcean's GenAI agent (powered by Llama 3.3 Instruct) to generate personalized travel plans and provide intelligent travel assistance through a chatbot interface (powered by GPT-4o model). The integration works as follows:

### Trip Planning
1. User selects destination, trip duration, and visit month
2. Frontend sends request to server action
3. Server action communicates with DigitalOcean's GenAI agent
4. The agent generates comprehensive travel plan including:
   - Day-by-day itinerary
   - Weather-appropriate packing list
   - Local customs and cultural tips
   - Must-try local foods
   - Transportation recommendations

### AI Travel Assistant Chatbot 💬
The application features an intelligent chatbot powered by DigitalOcean GenAI with agent routing capabilities that provides:

- **Accommodation Suggestions**: Get personalized hotel and lodging recommendations based on budget, location preferences, and travel style
- **Cultural Do's and Don'ts**: Learn about local customs, etiquette, and cultural norms to avoid cultural faux pas
- **Scam Alerts**: Receive warnings about common tourist scams and how to avoid them
- **Local Tips**: Get insider knowledge about the destination from the AI assistant
- **Interactive Q&A**: Ask specific questions about your destination and get detailed, contextual responses

The chatbot uses DigitalOcean's agent routing to intelligently direct queries to the most appropriate knowledge base, ensuring accurate and helpful responses for travelers.
