## DigitalOcean GenAI Integration 🤖

The application uses DigitalOcean's GenAI agent (powered by Llama 3.3 Instruct) to generate personalized travel plans. The integration works as follows:

1. User selects destination, trip duration, and visit month
2. Frontend sends request to server action
3. Server action communicates with DigitalOcean's GenAI agent
4. The agent generates comprehensive travel plan including:
   - Day-by-day itinerary
   - Weather-appropriate packing list
   - Local customs and cultural tips
   - Must-try local foods
   - Transportation recommendations
